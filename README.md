# ✦ Mini-countdown – HTML/CSS Learning Project

## ✧ About This Project

This is a small animated countdown project created to deeply understand CSS animations.

The original code is not mine, is from: [github.com/bradtraversy ](https://github.com/bradtraversy)

The documentation added throughout the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files is my work.

The purpose of this project is educational:

- To understand how CSS animations work.
- To analyze how `transform` and `@keyframes` interact.
- To explore how JavaScript controls CSS-driven animations.
- To practice reading and documenting existing code.

This project is part of my learning process while studying Full Stack Web Development.

## ✧ Main Learning Focus

The primary goal was to deeply understand:

- `transform` and `transform-origin`.
- `@keyframes` animations.
- Animation timing and easing.
- Class-based state changes (`.in`, `.out`, `.hide`, `.show`).
- How the `animationend` event works in JavaScript.
- How CSS and JavaScript communicate through class manipulation.

The CSS file is heavily documented to explain:

- What each section does.
- Why specific properties are used.
- How layout and animation logic connect.

## ✧ What Happens in the Project

1. A countdown runs from **3 → 2 → 1 → 0**.
2. Each number rotates in and out using CSS animations.
3. JavaScript listens for animation completion events.
4. When the countdown finishes, a final **“GO”** message appears.
5. A replay button resets the animation.

## ✧ Technologies Used

- HTML5.
- CSS3 (animations, transforms, keyframes).
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation and event listeners).

---

## ✧ Why This Project Exists

Instead of simply copying and running code, I documented it line by line to understand:

- What each selector does.
- Why positioning works the way it does.
- How animations transition between states.
- How state is controlled using classes.

The goal is not just to make it work — but to understand **why** it works.

---

## ✧ Notes

- The visual behavior is primarily controlled by CSS.
- JavaScript acts as the controller that switches animation states.
- This is a study project, not an original implementation.
